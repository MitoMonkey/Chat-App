## Key Features
* On the Start screen the user can enter their name and choose a background color for the their message bubbles before joining the chat. 
* On the Chat screen the user can see past messages, create and send new ones as well as share pictures from their gallery, take fotos or share their location.
* Data gets stored online and offline, so message history is available while offline. (New messages can of course not be sent while offline.)

## User Stories 
* As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my friends and family.
* As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange the latest news.
* As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what I‚Äôm currently doing. ‚óè As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
* As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any time. 
* As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.

    * Expo (inkl Expo Go for Android)
    * Google Cloud Firestore Database
    * Google Firebase authentication
    * Gifted Chat library
    * React-navigation library (to enable gesture navigation between screens)
    * @expo/react-native-action-sheet (to display a menu for sharing fotos or location)

## Usage
Install dependencies: `npm install`

Start Metro Server (=expo testing environment): `expo start` 
From there you can run the app on your physical smartphone in the app Expo Go (which you need to install from the app store) or in a emulation created by Android Studio or iOS Simulator.
On Android: Shake device to open developer tools.
To stop the Metro Server (on Windows): Ctrl + C

The database used to store messages and pictures online is (Google Firestore)[https://console.firebase.google.com/]
You need a collection called "messages" in which each message will be stored as separate document.
The credentials to access the database need to be stored in the constructor of Chat.js, in a variable called `firebaseConfig`.
Anonymous authentication is also implemented through Google Firebase. 
Media files will also be stored in Firebase cloud storage.
